# Report: We Rate Dogs - Python Data Analytics Project

## Introduction

"We Rate Dogs" is a popular Twitter account that rates pictures of adorable dogs submitted by its followers. The account uses a unique rating system that goes beyond traditional ratings and often adds humorous commentary. This project aims to analyze the data from the "We Rate Dogs" Twitter account using Python data analytics techniques.

## Data Collection

The data was collected by using Twitter's API to access the account's tweets. The gathered data includes various attributes for each tweet, such as the tweet ID, timestamp, text, rating, dog stage (if available), and image predictions. Additionally, the data was enhanced by including the number of favorites (likes) and retweets for each tweet.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Data cleaning and preprocessing were essential to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis. The process involved the following steps:

1. Removing retweets: To avoid duplications, all retweets were removed from the dataset.

2. Handling missing data: Some tweets lacked essential information, such as dog stages or image predictions. These missing values were handled appropriately to avoid bias in the analysis.

3. Extracting ratings: The unique rating system used in "We Rate Dogs" often involved fractions, decimals, or multiple ratings within a tweet. We extracted the ratings from the tweet text using regular expressions to ensure consistency.

4. Dealing with outliers: Ratings that seemed unrealistic or outliers were addressed to maintain the integrity of the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis aimed to understand the characteristics of the data and derive insights. Key findings from the analysis include:

1. Most popular dog stages: The data revealed that "pupper" was the most common dog stage, followed by "doggo," "puppo," and "floofer."

2. Distribution of ratings: The ratings given to dogs were overwhelmingly positive, with the majority falling within the range of 10 to 13.

3. Relationship between favorites and retweets: There was a strong positive correlation between the number of favorites and retweets, indicating that tweets with more favorites were also retweeted more frequently.

## Data Visualization

To enhance understanding and communicate insights effectively, various data visualizations were created:

1. Bar charts: Bar charts were used to visualize the distribution of dog stages, ratings, and the number of favorites and retweets.

2. Time series plot: A time series plot was employed to visualize the tweet activity over time.

3. Scatter plot: A scatter plot was used to depict the relationship between favorites and retweets.

## Conclusion

The "We Rate Dogs" Python data analytics project provided valuable insights into the Twitter account's tweeting behavior and user engagement. By analyzing and visualizing the data, we gained a deeper understanding of the most popular dog stages, the distribution of ratings, and the correlation between favorites and retweets.

The project showcased the power of Python data analytics libraries in handling, cleaning, and analyzing real-world data from social media platforms. It also demonstrated the importance of data visualization in conveying complex information in a clear and concise manner.

Overall, this analysis adds to our appreciation of the adorable dog ratings on Twitter and highlights the success of "We Rate Dogs" in engaging its audience through humor and cute dog pictures.
